# The improvement work of Chinese Segmentation Model
## BCMI-NLP lab in SJTU
* Built a universal Chinese word segmentation for different open corpus and added some rules to the
segmentation results to meet different segmentation rules.
* Reproduced the work that Modeling Named Entity Embedding Distribution into Hypersphere and
applied it to the NER(named entity recognition).
* Used NER and semantic analysis to improve the efficiency of the neural word segmentation.

# Alias method and MH based acceleration algorithm for Biterm Topic Model
* Implemented Biterm Topic Model (BTM) using java code as baseline.
* Conducted some experiments of our new alogorithm to vertify its efficiency.
* Fast BTM successfully reduces sampling complexity of BTM from O(K) to O(1).
