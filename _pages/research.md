## The Improvement Work of Chinese Segmentation Model
#### BCMI-NLP lab in SJTU(Advisor: [Prof.Hai Zhao](http://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~zhaohai))       
#### May 2018 - Present
* Built a universal Chinese word segmentation for different open corpus and added some rules to the
segmentation results to meet different segmentation rules.
* Reproduced the work that Modeling Named Entity Embedding Distribution into Hypersphere and
applied it to the NER(named entity recognition).
* Used NER and semantic analysis to improve the efficiency of the neural word segmentation.

## House Price Forecasting Model in Shanghai
#### Course project in Data Ming class (Advisor: [Prof. Lei Fan](http://infosec.sjtu.edu.cn/index.php?m=article&f=view&id=155))   
#### May. 2018 - June 2018
* Used Scrapy Framework to get more than 70,000 pices of house information including 7 atrtibutes and
price in Shanghai ,and then used CRF++ tools to do chinese segmentation work.
* Exploited machine learning algorithms including linear-regression, decision Tree ,Random Forest and
XGBoost after data preprocessing including data cleaning and decoding.Adjusted the parameters in
the XGBoost model for the best performance.
