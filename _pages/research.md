## The Improvement Work of Chinese Segmentation Model
#### BCMI-NLP lab in SJTU(Advisor: [Prof.Hai Zhao](http://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~zhaohai))       
#### May 2018 - Present
* Reproduced the work that Modeling Named Entity Embedding Distribution into Hyper-sphere and
applied it to the NER(named entity recognition)    
* Analyzing different segmentation rules of open corpus and the cause and types of error when training
and testing in different corpus excluding the error when training and testing in the same domain   
* I am doing some work about building a universal Chinese word segmentation and adding some rules to
the segmentation results to meet different segmentation rules. At the same time I will use NER and
semantic analysis to improve the accuracy of the neural word segmentation

## Alias Method and MH Based Acceleration Algorithm for Biterm Topic Model
#### July 2016 - May 2017(Advisor: [Advisor: Dr.Xingwei He](http://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~zhaohai))
* Implemented Biterm Topic Model (BTM) using java code as baseline and proposed FastBTM model
which is based on Metropolis - Hastings and alias method
* Carried some experiments of our new algorithm on three different datasets including two short text
datasets and one long document dataset and we compared the convergence speed of our FastBTM with
BTM
* Fast BTM successfully reduces sampling complexity of BTM from O(K) to O(1) (K denotes the number
of topics) and the FastBTM is effective for reducing the sampling time of both short text and long text
datasets

## The Optimization of Blockchain Confidential Transaction Algorithm
#### Shanghai Jiao Tong University PRP project  (Advisor: [Prof.Xuejia Lai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B67-NyQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN))
#### Sept. 2017 - Mar. 2018 
* Read some documents and papers about confidential transaction and researched the core technology
including the Pedersen commitment using the math knowledge of Elliptic curve and homomorphic
encryption    
* Improved the operation efficiency and performance of the algorithm by optimizing the Borromean Range
Signature in storage space and Range Proof algorithm in time by 5% in the confidential transaction    
* Set up a network using Hyper Fabric platform to realize some Blockchain services such as transaction
and query

## House Price Forecasting Model in Shanghai
#### Course project in Data Ming class (Advisor: [Prof. Lei Fan](http://infosec.sjtu.edu.cn/index.php?m=article&f=view&id=155))   
#### May. 2018 - June 2018
* Used Scrapy Framework to get more than 70,000 pices of house information including 7 atrtibutes and
price in Shanghai ,and then used CRF++ tools to do chinese segmentation work.
* Exploited machine learning algorithms including linear-regression, decision Tree ,Random Forest and
XGBoost after data preprocessing including data cleaning and decoding.Adjusted the parameters in
the XGBoost model for the best performance.

## Android Application Development
#### Course project in Softwear Engineering  
#### Feb. 2018 - June 2018
* Developed a multi-functional calculator in the Android using Java,which can do math calculation ,unit
conversion and currency converter.
* Designed a restaurant management system containing SQL database via UML Model for window PC
terminals.

## Other Relevent Course Projects
#### Jan. 2017 - Dec. 2017
* Developed a multi-user chat program with server and client front using Python and Socket.,which realize
real-time online user prompts and data transmission in any form such as text messages,fles,emojis and
pictures .
* Designed and developed some pages for students to create and query activities with the help of WeChat
Official Account platform and MySQL.
